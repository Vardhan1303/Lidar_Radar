# Lidar and Radar System: Tasks Overview

This repository consolidates two projects completed as part of the "Lidar and Radar Systems" course in the Master's program in Mechatronics at the University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg-Weingarten. **Task 1** evaluates the influence of foggy conditions on sensors (Lidar and Radar), analyzing their performance using processed sensor data. **Task 2** assesses a YOLO-based object detection model applied to the KITTI dataset, focusing on precision, recall, and visualization of bounding boxes using Bird's Eye View (BEV) images. Both tasks aim to provide insights into sensor and detection system capabilities, supported by detailed metrics and visualizations. The repository includes code, datasets, and outputs for academic and research use, with appropriate attribution to Prof. Dr. Stefan Elser and the KITTI Dataset contributors.
